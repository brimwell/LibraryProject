LARGE PIECES
-- Button to change its 'read' status





NEEDS:
-- Limit the pages input field to just numbers
-- Make sure that the three inputs are required
    -- Maybe a message if someone tries to submit without having all the information?
-- Form keeps old values, so when you go back to the modal it has what you inputted previously





STYLING
-- Cards
-- Read vs notRead classes
-- grid layout? for cards?
-- form presentation
    -- do i add an extra div for a message if you dont fill out all fields?

IDEA
when creating buttons in the card divs, could I add an onclick='somefunction()' ??
Then instead of having all these eventlisteners and code in the displayLibrary function I could separate them
It might work as well to simply have the .... eventListener trigger a function that Ive declared outside, though Im not sure of that would work...
